# Anniversary Webpage

This is for my parter whom I love very much. 


This was made taking inspiration from multiple other projects. I have also used some assets from other open-source projects.
The project is beginner level.

PS: If u do happen to go through the code the try not messing with the order of the components in each html file. It will just make the entire animation sequence stop working.
